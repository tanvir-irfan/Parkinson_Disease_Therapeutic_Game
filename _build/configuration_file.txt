# This is a comment. MAX_REACH is the distance we got from the calibration screen which means that is the farthest participant can reach.

# Define how many positions do you want  participant and MAX_REACH
POS_BELOW_MAX_REACH=2

# Define how many positions do you want that is FAR than MAX_REACH
POS_ABOVE_MAX_REACH=3

# Define how many positions do you want for each position. The total number of trials will be = (POS_BELOW_MAX_REACH + POS_ABOVE_MAX_REACH) * NUMBER_OF_TRIAL_PER_POSITION
NUMBER_OF_TRIAL_PER_POSITION=3

# This is the time participant will get to reach the target after they guessed they can reach the target.

# This is the time interval between two trials.

# Minimum distance a target may be placed is = MAX_REACH - LOWER_RANGE. Please be noted that if you place '5' here it will be treated as 0.5 in code.
LOWER_RANGE=3

# Maximum distance a target may be placed is = MAX_REACH + HIGHER_RANGE. Please be noted that if you place '5' here it will be treated as 0.5 in code.
